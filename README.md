# My-paint

Its a simple app developed in Processing that lets you draw.

The TUIO library along with reacTIVision is used to allow the users to draw using
symbols instead of their mouse.

The camera is used to recognise the symbol and based on its X and Y coordinates draws on the processing application.

The symbol has to be rotated 90 deg to draw on the application (acts like a mouse click/ drag).

The symbol has to be rotated -90 deg to clear the application/ screen.

## Future inprovements
